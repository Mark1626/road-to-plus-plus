# OpenCL Examples

1. **cl_info** get info about 
  + make cl_ifo
  + ./cl_info
2. **vector_add** add of two arrays and store it in a third array
  + make vector_add_gpu
  + ./vector_add_gpu
  + make vector_add_cpu
  + ./vector_add_cpu
3. **gol** Game of life in OpenCL
  + make gol_cpu
  + ./gol_cpu
  + make gol_gpu
  + ./gol_gpu
4. **atomic Sum of array** Sum of array, involves atomic addition
5. **sandpile** Abelian sandpile(there is a slight problem with the generated image, and the implementation suffers from latency problem with CPU-GPU communication)
