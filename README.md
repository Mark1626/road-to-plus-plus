# Road to C++

This repo contains things I'm going to try out to learn C++

## Rough brainstorm of ideas

- [] Go through [CPP Tutor](https://github.com/banach-space/cpp-tutor)
- [] Build a Game of Life which could work for large cells
- [] Understand debugging with `lldb` and try out `rr`
- [] Contribute to a OSS project using C++
- [] Write a toy compiler
